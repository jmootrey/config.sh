eConnect SCENE Control Scripts

This scene script folder contains eConnect scripts to automate eConnect Cabin control functions. The
folder used may be /opt/scenes when using /opt software updates to install scripts or, alternatively, 
be place under a /mnt/user folder if interactive access is required. NOTE: the system_paths table 
must indicate the installed location.

To utilize this feature, the folder must have a file "script_start". An sample script_start
is included in the RHT example release. Automated cabin scripts more than likely will utilize the
utility 'icdapp' to communicate with the econapp and msecsleep for delay/timing requirements.
Those utilities are also included in the RHT example setup. 

Scene scripts must have the naming convention *.sh to be enumerated into the database for GUI
selection and execution. A softwarei/USB update may be used to setup this folder. Additionally, the
scripts should have the following comment lines (or default values are used):

# SCRIPTID 1
# COMMENT Informative text that appears in the database/GUI is typed here
# TYPE 0
# STARTUP 0
# EXCLUSIVE 1

Where '# SCRIPTID N' is a required comment. The script ID should be a unique identifier that identifies
the script in the system. The value of N is sent with the SCENE_SCRIPT ICD cammand to start/stop a script.
COMMENT provides information for passengers as to what selecting the script will do (255 char max);
TYPE is 0 for passenger available and 1 for maintenance menu only. This indicates to the GUI whether to present
the script in the passenger menu or make it a maintenance only item (default 0); STARTUP value of 0 indicates
a manual selection is required and 1 to automatically run at eConnect power-up (default 0); EXCLUSIVE
indicates the script must be by itself for the actions it performs. Valid values: 1=Lighting/IO scripts,
2=System A/V scripts, 3=both.  Two scripts of the same type will not be run together. Type 3 cannot run with
either type 1 or 2 scripts. If, for example, a lighting script is running with "EXLUSIVE 1" and another
exclusive lighting script is started (TYPE 1 or 3), the first script will be terminated and the 2nd script
will be started. If the second script startup is an AV script (EXCLUSIVE 2), it will run without interfering
and both can run together. A value of 0 (default) indicates the script will always run when selected. NOTE: 
If multiple lighting control scripts are run together, one might expect unpredictable lighting effects.
